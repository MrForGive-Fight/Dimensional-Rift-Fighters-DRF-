# üî¥ PROBLEM IDENTIFIED

You're running Claude Code **1.0.58** instead of **2.0.1**.

## What Happened

The installation script you ran showed "Version: 2.0.1" but it **didn't actually update** the file at `.local\bin\claude.exe`. 

The existing file there is from **August 7, 2025** (old installation) and was never replaced.

## What You're Running Now

‚ùå **B:\~BUN\root\claude.exe** (version 1.0.58) - wrong!  
‚ùå **C:\Users\ibeth\.local\bin\claude.exe** (old version from Aug 7) - wrong!

## Solutions (Choose ONE)

### üéØ SOLUTION 1: Diagnose First (Recommended)
Run this to see exactly what's wrong:
```powershell
.\diagnose-claude.ps1
```
This will tell you which versions exist and where.

### üîß SOLUTION 2: Clean Reinstall
This removes the old file and installs fresh:
```powershell
.\reinstall-claude.ps1
```
**NOTE:** Close all Claude Code windows first!

### ‚ö° SOLUTION 3: Manual Fix
1. Close all Claude Code windows
2. Delete: `C:\Users\ibeth\.local\bin\claude.exe`
3. Run in PowerShell:
   ```bash
   curl -fsSL http://claude.ai/install.sh | bash
   ```
4. Then use `.\launch-claude-FORCE.ps1`

### üöÄ SOLUTION 4: Use New Version After Fixing
Once reinstalled, launch with:
```powershell
.\launch-claude-FORCE.ps1
```

## Why launch-claude-new.ps1 Didn't Work

The script tried to launch the file at `.local\bin\claude.exe`, but:
1. That file is from August (old version)
2. OR the PATH is still overriding it
3. The new installation never actually updated the file

## Files Created to Help You

- `diagnose-claude.ps1` - See what's installed where
- `reinstall-claude.ps1` - Clean reinstall
- `launch-claude-FORCE.ps1` - Launch bypassing PATH
- `SETUP_COMPLETE.md` - Your DFR settings (still valid!)

## Quick Action Plan

1. **Close** all Claude Code windows
2. **Run**: `.\diagnose-claude.ps1` to see the problem
3. **Run**: `.\reinstall-claude.ps1` to fix it
4. **Launch**: `.\launch-claude-FORCE.ps1` to use it

Then verify with `claude --version` inside Claude Code - it should say **2.0.1**!

## Your DFR Settings

Don't worry - all your game configuration is safe in:
- `.claude\settings.local.json` (active)
- `.claude\settings.local.json.backup` (full backup)

Once you get 2.0.1 running, your DFR game rules will load automatically! üéÆ
